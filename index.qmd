Hello, and welcome to my website. This site summarises my experience as a researcher. I hope that with the knowledge and skills I am developing, I can ...

Currently, I am a second year doctoral researcher at the University of Sheffield, due to graduate in October 2025. My project is an interdisciplinary venture across Psychology, Political Science and Political Communication Science, using survey experiments to uncover how the British public react to transparency disclosures on online political adverts e.g., extra information about who paid for an advert and decisions about what groups of people it has been shown to. Empirical research into this topic came into focus after the UK government introduced new legislation in 2021 requiring many political campaigners to include a 'digital imprint' with their material. These measures are intended to help the public more easily determine who is behind the material being posted, tackling online threats while building public trust in the integrity of our elections and the trustworthiness of legitimate campaigners. My research aims to interrogate these claims, asking what effect do digital imprints actually appear to have, and what role could they reasonably be expected to play in tackling the opportunities and threats of online political campaigning techniques.

This project is made possible by my wonderful supervisory team Professor Tom Stafford, Department of Psychology and Professor Kate Dommett, Department of Politics and International Relations. 

I am also very fortunate that this project was developed alongside the work of the Electoral Reform Society, a UK-based independent political campaign organisation. The ERS do great work in researching and communicating to the public how our electoral system, among other things, could be adapted to strengthen UK democracy. With their keen focus on transparency in digital campaigning, I am able to clearly connect the theory of my project into tangible policy implications. Between May and October 2024 in the run up and aftermath of the 2024 General Election, I will be completing an internship with them. During this time, I will support the communication of research based arguments on the importance of transparency in political campaigning to the public.
