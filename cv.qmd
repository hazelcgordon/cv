<h2>Research Experience</h2>

<p class="center-text"><strong>Research Assistant in Political Psychology, Part Time</strong><br>University of Sheffield, September 2019 - September 2021</p>

<p>An ESRC funded research project investigating how political satire, such as memes and satirical television shows, influenced political perceptions. As a key tool of political communication, particularly in the internet age, this project used a mixed methods approach to explore if individuals with opposing political views reacted differently to different types of humorous messaging, and asked how this could shape 'echo chamber' online environments. In my role as a research assistant:</p>

- I acted as a mediator or assistant to the mediator across 13 focus groups.
- I worked regularly within an inter-disciplinary research team to develop the experimental methodology and interpret the meaning and wider significance of the findings.
- I sourced and recruited professional comedians to develop bespoke satirical material for our research, managing communications between them and the team.
- I developed ways to increase the validity of methodological decisions, for example by creating a coding system for experimental materials to check those used in the study targeted opposing ideologies with equal breadth, ensuring experimental conditions were comparable.
- I contributed to manuscript development and made suggestions for structural revisions to communicate the research with more clarity.
